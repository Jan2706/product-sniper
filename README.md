# Product Sniper

The Product Sniper is a neat application that allows you to check if an item on a webpage is available!

This project is a work in progress, so please feel free to request any features or bug fixes.

## Documentation

### Prerequisites

In order to use this application, you will need to install two Python libraries:

1. [Beautiful Soup 4](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) - for pulling data out of HTML websites. 
2. [Requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/) - allows you to send HTTP requests easily.

To install them, do a simple `pip3 install bs4 requests` in your terminal.

Thats it!

(If come across any issues, please refer to their documentation).
